Hi, I am Jack Maginnes (aka: [@\_stigward](https://twitter.com/_stigward)). 
- **Current Position**: Security Researcher at [Block](https://block.xyz/).
- **Previous Position**: Senior Security Engineer - IoT team at [Praetorian](https://www.praetorian.com/).

Outside of security, I enjoy fly fishing, snowboarding, hiking, and pretty much anything else outside. 
Also a huge fitness geek, just completed my first half Ironaman in May 2022, and training for a full in Fall 2023.
